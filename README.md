# Chatbot
A simple dataset to fine-tune a chatbot for particular needs.

Synthetically generated dataset containing 14 columns and 10,000 records:

Metrics include:
- User ID: An identifier for each user in the conversation. This can help in tracking and analyzing user-specific interactions.
- User Utterance: The random text of the user's message or question. This is what initiates the conversation.
- Bot Response: The chatbot's reply or answer to the user's message.
- Timestamp: The date and time when each message was sent. This can help in maintaining the chronological order of messages.
- Context/Session ID: An identifier for the conversation session. This can help in distinguishing between different chat sessions.
- Entities:  If the conversation involves specific entities or keywords, include a field to capture them (e.g., product names, locations, dates).
- User Feedback: An optional field where users can provide feedback on the chatbot's responses (e.g., rating the response or stating whether it was helpful).
- Conversation Outcome:  Indicate whether the conversation was successful, incomplete, or resulted in a specific outcome. This helps in evaluating the effectiveness of the chatbot.
- User Profile: Include any relevant user information, such as age, gender, or location, if available and anonymized.
- Channel/Platform: Specify the platform or channel where the conversation took place (e.g., website chat, mobile app, social media).
- Language: The language used in the conversation, which is particularly important if you're training a multilingual chatbot.
- User Emotion/Sentiment: Capture the user's emotional tone or sentiment in the conversation (e.g., happy, frustrated, neutral).
- Location:  If location data is relevant, include a field to record it (e.g., user's location or location-based queries).
- User Segment: Categorize users into different segments (e.g., new users, returning customers, premium users).
